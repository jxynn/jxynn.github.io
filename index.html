                                            <p style="color: black">Hey, my name is Jay! I'm a 3rd year Mathematics & Social Sciences student at the University of Toronto. I am a Southeast Asian-Canadian woman in STEM with an interest for curriculum development and instructional design. In the past, I have assisted with the research and revision of technology-integrated pedagogical methods at the secondary and post-secondary levels. I am currently involved in a variety of projects centered around data science and operations research. </p>
                                            <p style="color: black">Being in a male-dominated field of study, I am passionate about closing the gender, racial/ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in the mathematical and computational sciences. Through my work, I hope to improve the content and expand the accessibility of math/tech education resources.</p>
                                            <p style="color: black">Given my positionality, it was initially very difficult for me to conduct my analysis from a purely qualitative approach. I often hesitated to question the participants, thereby limiting my opportunity to learn about engineering design. However, if there was any mention of programming or optimizing specifications (i.e., more quantitative aspects), I found myself becoming more attentive and enthusiastic with my observations. I was also highly fixiated on the sociocultural angle of engineering design since the opportunity challenge assigned to my team (see Experience section) was familiar to me on a personal level. Throughout the study, I frequently attempted to deconstruct the participants' learning progress, namely why they faced various design/prototyping problems and how they overcame them, to better understand what it is like to "be in their shoes" </p>
                                            <p style="color: black">As I did not possess any technical knowledge or skills that would have allowed me to fully contribute to designing, let alone constructing a prototype prior to the start of my independent study, my position in the team with respect to the opportunity challenge was restricted to tertiary research. Nevertheless, it was a very fulfilling experience to be able to explore the domain of engineering science and engineering design through the progress of my team's work.</p>

                                <p style="color: black">This is my team, "Forklift Certified". Aren't they just the cutest &hearts;? Michael (in the brown collared jacket) is a fellow social science and humanities student in ESC490. The remaining 6 members are engineering science (hereinafter EngSci) students of ESC204: Praxis III. 2 of the members are interested in going into electrical engineering; 2 different members wish to pursue robotics; and the remaining 2 members are undecided. </p>
                                <p style="color: black">During the DD1 (design dossier 1) phase, the team unanimously agreed to divide the sections based on each individual member's strengths, and provide additional help in other sections if necessary. While it was not explicitly stated, I assume that this approach to the project management of the dossier was because each EngSci member wished to gain more practical experience in their field of interest. For instance, EngSci member "B" (electrical engineering) showed immense excitement when discussing the functions of motors and circuitry with me, taking immediate initiative in planning this aspect of the prototype design. Similar approaches were taken in the DD2 stage; however there was a greater prevalence of collaboration involved due to stricter time constraints and a heavier workload. </p>

                                <p style="color: black">This is a diagram showcasing the underpinnings of engineering design presented in the first ESC204 lecture. My exploration focused on generalizing the applications of this procedure to our design/prototyping processes. To give a better understanding of how this framework works, consider the case of this blog. In ESC490, I was assigned the task to produce a final artefact that sufficiently presents what I learned about engineering design. There are several aspects I could cover such as the pedagogy of the design process, social factors, etc. Upon brainstorming the possible approaches I could take, I decided to analyze the design chain as a whole, rather than focusing on one specific aspect of the framework. That is, I wanted to convey what I learned about engineering design by generalizing the stages of the design chain using what I observed from my participation in Praxis III. </p>
                                <p style="color: black">Since I had some coding background, I decided to create a web-based blog to present my Final Artefact. I took this approach knowing that I would able to convey my experience in a manner that was feasible for me and enjoyable for my ESC490 audience. I then produced a low-fidelty design of the general structure and functions of my blog; however I quickly realized that my HTML and CSS skills were too weak to develop this initial design. Hence, I decided to retrieve and customize a blog template from online resources instead. After several iterations of redesigning my blog, I finally created a layout I was satisfied with and capable of producing. I then proceeded to revise the code template to fit the details and functionality of my final design (high-fidelity prototyping) to produce what you are viewing now! </p>

                                <p style="color: black">The diagram above (produced by EngSci member "A" (robotics engineering)) showcases the context they agreed to explore, i.e., the ergonomical aspects of bamboo stripping/cutting/splitting. They ultimately wished to standardize the bamboo processing methods by addressing the risk of injury. This was not what they had planned to explore in the beginning. Initially, the EngSci members wanted to optimize the efficiency (speed) of the processing methods. However, due to financial constraints of the materials involved as well as the overall complexity of the idea, this approach was not taken. From this observation, I interpreted the value proposition to be a refinement of a product/service in such a way that is advantageous (i.e., cost-effective) to the stakeholders. Additionally, it bridges the gap between the 'context' stage and 'approaches' stage. </p>

These sessions were typically dedicated to brainstorming low-fidelity designs for our final prototype. The image above shows the "Forklift Certified" members writing their process review debrief based on previous refinements to their morph charts and requirements model. After iterating through the failures and potential fixes of the prototype components, the members opted for a more simplified design which was "feasible enough" to build, stated EngSci member "F" (electrical engineering). </p>

                                <p style="color: black"></i>By the end of every brainstorming session, we had devised a new design concept for our prototype. The image above shows our first prototype which combines the design and functionality of a '3-in-1' "Apple Peeling, Slicer, and Corer" system. While we continued to use this processing method and even ended up incorporating it into our final prototype, we discovered the potential issue of bamboo splitting, which could 1. injure the workers preparing the bamboo, and 2. cut uneven strips of bamboo, which will negatively affect the quality of weaving patterns. Furthermore, the 'cranking' actions required by this system contradicted our value proposition. After conducting further research and mathematical calculations, we decided against this design concept and continued to brainstorm ways to improve our prototype. From these observations, I deduced that similar to the approaches (brainstorming) stage, low-fidelity designs are a trial-and-error stage of the engineering design chain.</p>

Observe that there are several differences in terms of functionality compared to our low-fidelity design. Namely, our realized high fidelity prototype utilizes a rack and pinion as opposed to a pulley/conveyer belt system in order to improve load transfer and ultimately reduce the dangers of splitting the bamboo. Consequently, we decided that it was best to slice the bamboo vertically rather than horizontally on the cutting platform, thereby improving the ergonomics, efficiency, and consistency of the bamboo processing methods simultaneously. According to EngSci member "B" (electrical engineering), <i>"This is the superior method. The rack and pinion are the superior method."</i> This experience allowed me to deduce that high-fidelity designs are closer to what we expect how our final prototype will appear and function.</p>

While observing the development of this model, members were visibly uncertain of which subsystems were necessarily connected.

Indeed, by the nature of the course, these experiences forced me explore outside of my comfort zone and engage in a domain that was unfamiliar yet engaging to me. I learned about the difficulties and benefits working in a team setting which evidently shaped my perspectives of (heightened my respect for) the project management and designing/prototyping aspects of engineering science.
